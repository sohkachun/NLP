# Machine Learning and NLP Projects

## Project Overview
This repository contains a variety of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) projects. The projects span topics such as sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, text summarization, and semantic similarity. Each notebook demonstrates the implementation of different models and techniques to solve real-world problems using both structured and unstructured data.

## Files in the Repository

### NLP Projects
1. **BERT_Q&A_System.ipynb**
   - Implements a question-answering system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for extracting answers from a given passage of text.

2. **Cuisine-Text-Classification.ipynb**
   - A text classification model that classifies different types of cuisines based on the text of recipes. This notebook covers feature extraction techniques and classification models.

3. **Movie_Similarity_model.ipynb**
   - Implements a similarity model to compare movie plots and find similar movies. This notebook uses various NLP techniques such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure textual similarity between movie descriptions.

4. **Semantic_Similarity.ipynb**
   - Focuses on computing the semantic similarity between two pieces of text. This notebook demonstrates methods such as word embeddings and transformer models to quantify the similarity in meaning between texts.

5. **Sentiment_Analysis_Movie_Reviews.ipynb**
   - Implements a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The notebook explores different machine learning and deep learning approaches to text sentiment classification.

6. **Text_Classification.ipynb**
   - A general text classification notebook that demonstrates how to classify different categories of text. It covers preprocessing, model building, and evaluation for text classification tasks.

7. **Text_Summarization.ipynb**
   - Implements a text summarization model that generates concise summaries from longer pieces of text. The notebook uses transformer-based models and explores extractive and abstractive approaches to summarization.
